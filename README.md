Explanation of the Project:

In this project, I was asked to create a Tamagotchi game with any pet of my choosing.  I had to make it so you could feed, play with, and put your pet to sleep, and if it got too hungry, bored, or tired, it would die.  I chose to make my game with a pet cactus.

User Stories:

When the user enters their cactus's name into the input and pushes the "Start Game" button, the game begins.  The cactus's age starts at 0, and its hunger level, boredom level, and tiredness level start at 1.  The cactus's age increases by 1 every minute.  When the user clicks the "Feed Your Cactus" button, the cactus's hunger level decreases by 1.  When the user clicks the "Play With Your Cactus" button, the cactus's boredom level decreases by 1.  When the user clicks the "Put Your Cactus To Sleep" button, the cactus's tiredness level decreases by 1.  The hunger level, boredom level, and tiredness level increase by 1 every 1 minute.  If the cactus's hunger level, boredom level, or tiredness level reaches 10, the cactus dies and the game is over.  The game is reset and the user can start over with a new cactus.

Appoach Taken:  



Installation Instructions: 

Unsolved Problems: 

I wanted to do some extras like making the cactus's image change when it reaches certain ages or add images of it eating, playing, and sleeping when the user feeds it, plays with it, and puts it to sleep.  Unfortunately, I did not have time to do these.
